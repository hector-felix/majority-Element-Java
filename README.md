# majority-Element-Java
Assume you have an integer array A of n elements. A majority element of A is any element concurring in more
than bn/2c positions (so if n = 6 or n = 7, any majority element will occur in at least 4 positions). Assume that
elements cannot be ordered or sorted, but can be compared for equality. Design an efficient divide and conquer
algorithm to find a majority element in A or determine that no majority element exists. Time complexity of your
algorithm should be O(n · logn). Write the pseudocode of your algorithm and explain why the time complexity of
your algorihtm is indeed O(n ·logn). Note that you can use Algorithm 3 as the template of your pseudocode.
For example, if A = [1,2,1,1,3,1], we know that the majority element of A is 1, which should be returned by your
algorithm; however, if A = [1,2,2,1,3,1], we know that A does not have the majority element, your algorithm
should return NULL then.
